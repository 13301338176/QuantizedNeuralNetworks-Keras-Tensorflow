# qnn-keras-tensorflow
Train your own Quantized Neural Networks (QNN) - networks trained with quantized weights and activations - in Keras / Tensorflow.
If you use this code, please cite [B.Moons et al. "Minimum Energy Quantized Neural Networks", Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers, 2017.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bert-moons-41867143/).

This code is built on a [lasagne/theano](https://github.com/MatthieuCourbariaux/BinaryNet) and a [Keras/Tensorflow](https://github.com/DingKe/BinaryNet) version of [BinaryNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6573-binarized-neural-networks).
